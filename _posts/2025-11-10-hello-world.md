title: 'pyprint("Hello $world!")'

Just a quick post to (a) check I set this blog up correctly; and (b) introduce the
[new JuliaPy website](https://juliapy.github.io).

The plan, inspired somewhat by
[this discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/where-is-julia-heading-lack-of-clarity-about-priorities-long-term-direction-and-governance/133734/34?u=cjdoris)
(and the whole thread in general) is to post now and then with news and plans for all
things to do with Julia-Python interop. Of particular note is that we are slowly working
our way towards PythonCall.jl v1, so expect a number of posts on that topic.

Feel free to get in touch on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/),
[Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) or by creating an issue/discussion on any of the
repos.
